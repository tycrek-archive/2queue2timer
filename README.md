# 2queue2timer
Joins 2b2t.org queue at a specific time.

## How to use

1. Download the latest [Release](https://github.com/tycrek/2queue2timer/releases)
2. Open command prompt
3. Run `2q2t.exe`
4. Follow the on-screen prompts
5. Once it is counting down, feel free to use your PC. Just make sure the play button is visible so the program clicks the right thing

## Tips

- I know anarchy players don't like using random exe files so just use [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/) to check it first. Or also use your favourite antivirus software.
- This probably won't work in Fullscreen. Start the game in windowed, then just go fullscreen after it joins the queue.
- Right now it only works for times during the current day. For example, if the current time is 10:00 PM, you can't set it to join at 1:00 AM the next day.
- Turn off auto sleep or auto lock on your PC

## Why is the code so shit

I don't use Go very often. If you got a problem then open a PR lol
