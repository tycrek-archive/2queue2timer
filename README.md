# 2queue2timer
Joins 2b2t.org queue at a specific time.

## How to use

1. Download the latest [Release](https://github.com/tycrek/2queue2timer/releases)
2. Open command prompt
3. Run `2q2t.exe`
4. Follow the on-screen prompts
5. Once it is counting down, feel free to use your PC. Just make sure the play button is visible at the end of the countdown so the program clicks the right thing

## Tips

- This is useful if you want to join the queue an hour before you get off work, so it queues as you drive home.
- I know anarchy players don't like using random exe files so just use [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/) to check it first. Or also use your favourite antivirus software.
- This probably won't work in Fullscreen. Start the game in windowed, then just go fullscreen after it joins the queue.
- If you input an hour that is less than the current hour (i.e. inputting `3` when the current hour is `14`), 2q2t will schedule the click for the next day. This allows you to set the timer before you go to bed and be in queue when you wake up.
- Turn off auto sleep or auto lock on your PC

## Why is the code so shit

I don't use Go very often. If you got a problem then open a PR lol
